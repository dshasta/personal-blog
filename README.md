# personal-blog
Personal Blog CRUD app made with Express.js and EJS.

For my full stack course, instructions were to make a blogging app that could do the following:

1. Post Creation: Users should be able to create new posts.
2. Post Viewing: The home page should allow the user to view all their posts.
3. Post Update/Delete: Users should be [able to] edit and delete posts as needed.
4. Styling: The application should be well-styled and responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

I used Bootstrap and custom CSS for tweaks. I got very familiar with EJS and how to use it for website scalability.

I implemented code to maintain line breaks after publishing and viewing a post (which was not the default behavior).

I implemented custom blog post listing to give the app a cleaner look. After a post is submitted, a text link with only the blog title and current date appears. Link takes the user to the blog post where they can edit or delete.

Disclosure: While technical requirements and features were given, no solution code was provided.
